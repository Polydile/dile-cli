This is a CLI proyect to create scaffolding of Dile Components Web Components Catalog, specially the CRUD Components.

We are generating commands using commander.js

The commands index is on /lib/commands/index.js file.

All code always in English.

Whenever we create or edit features, they must be documented. There is a main `README.md` in the root folder.

Also we have specific READMEs for each command or feature in the `/docs` folder. This docs site is managed by Eleventy SSG. The commands docs are on '/docs/commands' folder. 

Code, comments and documentation should be always in English.
