# Attribution

We want to thank the following organizations and companies:

- [Lit](https://lit.dev/): The components are built with the Lit micro-library.
- [Dile Components](https://dile-components.com): This site uses Dile Components and serves as the CLI for that component catalog.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/): We use some of this icons library in our [Dile Components adaptation to web components](https://dile-components.com/icons/fontawesome-icons/).
- [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons): For the SVGs used in our icon repository.

We also want to send special thanks to [EscuelaIT](https://escuela.it/), the main Dile Components sponsor and promoter, and to Lit and Web Components instructor [Miguel Ángel Álvarez](https://twitter.com/midesweb).
